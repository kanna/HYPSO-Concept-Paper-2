\begin{abstract}
Ocean color processes with characteristic spectral information, such as algal blooms, demand consistent monitoring at lower costs and high-resolution remote sensing data that are quickly delivered after first observation. Given recent advances in sensor and microcomputer technology, we present the mission design of HYPSO-1, a 6U CubeSat at $500 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ altitude in Sun-Synchronous Orbit hosting a COTS-built pushbroom hyperspectral imager. The flight-ready camera covers wavelengths in the visual and near-infrared range, has a spectral bandpass of approximately $3.33 \hspace{3pt} \rm{nm}$ and swath width of $70 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$. Since spatial resolution can be poor due to its small optics and high orbital altitude and speed, using fundamental principles in geometry we show how HYPSO-1's ability to perform a slew maneuver during imaging enables spatial resolution to become better than $100 \hspace{3pt} \rm{m}$. The imager's Signal-to-Noise Ratio when observing typical water-leaving radiance is also characterized. To allow efficient downlink of large hyperspectral datasets over limited radio communications and ground station passes, we have carefully designed FPGA-based on-board image processing pipelines that reduce data size with lossless compression and dimensionality reduction or by extracting only characteristic features with target detection or classification algorithms. We justify the concept of operations with a simulated scenario where HYPSO-1 first observes a $40 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ by $40 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ area in the coast of Lofoten, Norway, then downlinks various data products to selected ground stations. The data products compressed with CCSDS123v1 can be downloaded in less than $1 \hspace{3pt} \rm{hr}$ and $36 \hspace{3pt} \rm{min}$ when taking into account the overhead in internal spacecraft bus communications, and less than $10 \hspace{3pt} \rm{min}$ without. Using dimensionality reduction, target detection and classification, the data products have latency of just a few minutes. After launch, HYPSO-1 will determine efficacy in providing tailored high-resolution and low-latency ocean color data from hyperspectral imaging small-satellites.

% Colorful ocean processes with distinguishable spectral characteristics, such as algal blooms, demands consistent monitoring and high-resolution remote sensing data from specific target areas that are quickly delivered after detection. 
% % To lower the cost and development time, cameras dedicated for ocean color such as hyperspectral imagers may be implemented on small-satellites. 
% We present a COTS-built pushbroom hyperspectral imager that is integrated on HYPSO-1, a 6U CubeSat at $500 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ altitude in a Sun-Synchronous Orbit. The imager offers approximately $3.33 \hspace{3pt} \rm{nm}$ spectral resolution in the wavelength range of $271-1007 \hspace{3pt} \rm{nm}$ and a swath width of $70 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ 
% % and approximately $58.6 \hspace{3pt} \rm{m}$ spatial resolution in the cross-track direction, although due to the satellite's speed the spatial resolution in the along-track direction can be worse than $500 \hspace{3pt} \rm{m}$ per frame. 
% but the spatial resolution is limited due to the camera's limitations on frame rate, high altitude and the satellite's speed at $7.61 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km/s}$. With a precise Attitude and Determination Control System, HYPSO-1 may improve the spatial resolution by performing a slew maneuver while imaging thus enabling the distance between sequential frames to become less than $100 \hspace{3pt} \rm{m}$ in the along-track direction and additionally the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is increased by the resulting overlapping frames. Such a slew maneuver requires more time for imaging thereby more frames are collected, rendering a datacube of a large size. To download such data over a limited radio link, HYPSO-1's important capability lies in the on-board FPGA-based image processing algorithms that aim for both alleviating the power budget and reducing the data with lossless compression and dimensionality reduction or by extracting only important features with target detection or classification. We present a simulated scenario where HYPSO-1 is observing a $40 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ by $40 \hspace{3pt} \rm{km}$ target area in Lofoten, Norway, and downlinking data products to a selected ground stations at NTNU and KSAT Lite. It is shown that the data products that are reduced minimally with only CCSDS123v1, can be downloaded to the end user in less than $1 \hspace{3pt} \rm{hr}$ and $36 \hspace{3pt} \rm{min}$ when taking into account the overhead in internal spacecraft bus communications, and less than $10 \hspace{3pt} \rm{min}$ without in a best case. For data products that have undergone dimensionality reduction, target detection and classification, the data latency is just a couple of minutes. The HYPSO-1 mission will demonstrate the efficacy of COTS-based hyperspectral imaging in providing high-resolution data with low latency.}
