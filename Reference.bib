abstract = {Deep convolutional networks–based super-resolution is a fast-growing field with numerous practical applications. In this exposition, we extensively compare more than 30 state-of-the-art super-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over three classical and three recently introduced challenging datasets to benchmark single image super-resolution. We introduce a taxonomy for deep learning–based super-resolution networks that groups existing methods into nine categories including linear, residual, multi-branch, recursive, progressive, attention-based, and adversarial designs. We also provide comparisons between the models in terms of network complexity, memory footprint, model input and output, learning details, the type of network losses, and important architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip-connections, filters). The extensive evaluation performed shows the consistent and rapid growth in the accuracy in the past few years along with a corresponding boost in model complexity and the availability of large-scale datasets. It is also observed that the pioneering methods identified as the benchmarks have been significantly outperformed by the current contenders. Despite the progress in recent years, we identify several shortcomings of existing techniques and provide future research directions towards the solution of these open problems. Datasets and codes for evaluation are publicly available at https://github.com/saeed-anwar/SRsurvey.},

In the last two decades, a variety of super-resolution methods have been proposed. These methods are usually very sensitive to their assumed model of data and noise, which limits their utility. This paper reviews some of these methods and addresses their shortcomings. We propose an alternate approach using 1 norm minimization and robust regularization based on a bilateral prior to deal with different data and noise models. This computationally inexpensive method is robust to errors in motion and blur estimation and results in images with sharp edges. Simulation results conﬁrm the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its superiority to other super-resolution methods.},

Transforming spectral information into an image provides a graphic means of mapping localized ionic, molecular, and protein–protein interactions. Spectroscopy also enables fluorophores with overlapping spectral features to be delineation. In this study, we provide the tools that a researcher needs to put into perspective instrumental contributions to a reported spectrum in order to gain greater understanding of the natural emission of the sample. We also show how to deduce the basic capabilities of a spectral confocal system. Finally, we show how to determine the true spectral bandwidth of an object, the illuminated area of a laser-excited object, and what is needed to optimize light throughput. © 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance. The International Charter “Space and Major Disasters”, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators. The paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments). Several trends may have a significant impact on the current performance: –The increasing number of space systems which are privately-owned and managed by commercial operators. –The emergence in Europe of shared-ownership or community-owned systems. Copernicus Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or Eumetsat satellites are two typical examples. –The development of dual-use capacities and the sovereignty dimension of these systems. –The development of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications. –The development of social media and crowd-based initiatives for humanitarian aid and emergency response. –Possible disruptions, such as large LEO constellations or GEO infrastructures enabling persistent observation. A common feature is the increased number of information sources and the higher real time dimension. Typical scenarios for the future are described and their likelihood is discussed, including political acceptance and the international dimension. Aside from rapid technological evolutions, two main driving factors are the capacity of national and international stakeholders to agree on governance and the sustainability of the economic models.},

The CCSDS-123 algorithm is a specialized compression standard assembled for space-related applications. In this paper, a parallel FPGA implementation of CCSDS-123 compression algorithm is presented. The proposed design can compress any number of samples in parallel allowed by resource and I/O bandwidth constraints. The CCSDS-123 processing core has been placed on Zynq-7035 SoC and veriﬁed against the existing reference software. The estimated power use scales approximately linearly with the number of samples processed in parallel. Finally, the proposed implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art implementations in terms of both throughput and power.},

abstract = {The retrieval of ocean color radiometry from space-based sensors requireson-orbit vicarious calibration to achieve the level of accuracy desired for quantitative oceanographic applications. The approach developed by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) adjusts the integrated instrument and atmospheric correction system to retrieve normalized water-leaving radiances that are in agreement with ground truth measurements.The method is independent of the satellite sensor or the source of the ground truth data, but it is specific to the atmospheric correction algorithm.The OBPG vicarious calibration approach is described in detail, and results are presented for the operational calibration of SeaWiFS using data from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and observations of clear-water sites in the South Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. It is shown that the vicarious calibration allows SeaWiFS to reproduce the MOBY radiances and achieve good agreement with radiometric and chlorophyll a measurements from independent in situ sources. We also find that the derived vicarious gains show no significant temporal or geometric dependencies, and that the mission-average calibration reaches stability after$\sim$20-40high-quality calibration samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of the vicariously calibrated retrieval system is relatively insensitive to the assumptions inherent in our approach.},

The instrument is not equipped with any onboard spectral and radiometric calibration devices. Here we describe vicarious calibration techniques that have been used in converting the HICO raw digital numbers to calibrated radiances. The spectral calibration is based on matching atmospheric water vapor and oxygen absorption bands and extraterrestrial solar lines. The radiometric calibration is based on comparisons between HICO and the EOS/MODIS data measured over homogeneous desert areas and on spectral reflectance properties of coral reefs and water clouds. Improvements to the present vicarious calibration techniques are possible as we gain more in-depth understanding of the HICO laboratory calibration data and the ISS HICO data in the future.},

  abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral remote sensing, is based on the characterization of Earth surface materials and processes through spectrally-resolved measurements of the light interacting with matter. The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However, most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers, as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of EnMAP consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400:1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180:1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. EnMAP images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. EnMAP will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.},

  abstract  = {Many types of hyperspectral image processing can benefit from knowledge of noise levels in the data, which can be derived from sensor physics. Surprisingly, such information is rarely provided or exploited. Usually, the image data are represented as radiance values, but this representation can lead to suboptimal results, for example in spectral difference metrics. Also, radiance data do not provide an appropriate baseline for calculation of image compression ratios. This paper defines two alternative representations of hyperspectral image data, aiming to make sensor noise accessible to image processing. A ``corrected raw data'' representation is proportional to the photoelectron count and can be processed like radiance data, while also offering simpler estimation of noise and somewhat more compact storage. A variance-stabilized representation is obtained by square-root transformation of the photodetector signal to make the noise signal-independent and constant across all bands while also reducing data volume by almost a factor 2. Then the data size is comparable to the fundamental information capacity of the sensor, giving a more appropriate measure of uncompressed data size. It is noted that the variance-stabilized representation has parallels in other fields of imaging. The alternative data representations provide an opportunity to reformulate hyperspectral processing algorithms to take actual sensor noise into account.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many different techniques are used for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth in the atmosphere. In some cases differences among these techniques can be important, especially in the UV region of the spectrum and under clean atmospheric conditions. The authors recommend that the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth be approached by going back to the first principles of Rayleigh scattering theory rather than the variety of curve-fitting techniques currently in use. A survey of the literature was conducted in order to determine the latest values of the physical constants necessary and to review the methods available for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth. The recommended approach requires the accurate calculation of the refractive index of air based on the latest published measurements. Calculations estimating Rayleigh optical depth should be done as accurately as possible because the inaccuracies that arise can equal or even exceed other quantities being estimated, such as aerosol optical depth, particularly in the UV region of the spectrum. All of the calculations are simple enough to be done easily in a spreadsheet.},

The coefficient was determined by use of an improved algorithm based on the Ciddor algorithm \[Appl. Opt.35, 1566 (1996)\], extended by us over the 0.20--0.23-{\textmu}m wavelength range to evaluate the moist air refractive index as a function of wavelength, air pressure, temperature, water-vapor partial pressure, and CO2 volume concentration. The King depolarization factor was also defined taking into account the moisture conditions of air. The results indicate that the influence of water vapor on Rayleigh scattering cannot be neglected at tropospheric altitudes: for standard atmospheric conditions represented in terms of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1976) model, the relative variations produced by water vapor in the Rayleigh scattering parameters at a 0.50-{\textmu}m wavelength turn out to be equal to {\textminus}0.10\% in the moist air refractivity at sea level (where the water-vapor partial pressure is equal to $\approx$7.8 hPa), {\textminus}0.04\% in the sea-level King factor, {\textminus}0.24\% in the sea-level Rayleigh-scattering cross section, and {\textminus}0.06\% in the Rayleigh-scattering optical depth.},

  abstract  = {Many spaceborne sensors have been deployed to image the ocean in the visible portion of the spectrum. Information regarding the concentration of water constituents is contained in the water-leaving radiance---the radiance that is backscattered out of the water and subsequently propagates to the top of the atmosphere. Recognizing that it depends on the viewing and Sun geometry, ways have been sought to normalize this radiance to a single Sun-viewing geometry---forming the normalized water-leaving radiance. This requires understanding both the bidirectional nature of the upwelling radiance just beneath the surface and the interaction of this radiance with the air--water interface. I believe that the latter has been incorrectly computed in the past when a water surface roughened by the wind is considered. The presented computation suggests that, for wind speeds as high as 20 m/s, the influence of surface roughness is small for a wide range of Sun-viewing geometries, i.e., the transmittance of the (whitecap-free) air--water interface is nearly identical (within 0.01) to that for a flat interface.},

The goal of this work is to elucidate the effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of retrieved constituent concentrations. Large variations in the magnitude and spectral shape of the reflectances from coastal waters complicate the impact of SNR on the accuracy of estimation. Due to the low reflectance of water, the actual SNR encountered for a water target is usually quite lower than the prescribed SNR. The low SNR can be a significant source of error in the estimated constituent concentrations. Simulated and measured at-surface reflectances were used in this study. A radiative transfer code, Tafkaa, was used to propagate the at-surface reflectances up and down through the atmosphere. A sensor noise model based on that of the spaceborne hyperspectral sensor HICO was applied to the at-sensor radiances. Concentrations of chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids were estimated using an optimized error minimization approach and a few semi-analytical algorithms. Improving the SNR by reasonably modifying the sensor design can reduce estimation uncertainties by 10\% or more.},

The GLC model is capable of describing all perspective (pinhole), orthographic, and many multiperspective (including pushbroom and two-slit) cameras, as well as epipolar plane images. It also includes three new and previously unexplored multiperspective linear cameras. Our GLC model is both general and linear in the sense that, given any vector space where rays are represented as points, it describes all 2D affine subspaces (planes) that can be formed by affine combinations of 3 rays. The incident radiance seen along the rays found on subregions of these 2D affine subspaces are a precise definition of a projected image of a 3D scene. The GLC model also provides an intuitive physical interpretation, which can be used to characterize real imaging systems. Finally, since the GLC model provides a complete description of all 2D affine subspaces, it can be used as a tool for first-order differential analysis of arbitrary (higher-order) multiperspective imaging systems.},

The technique is feasible on planar scene such as large-scale paintings or aerial/satellite images that are considered to be planar. The image integration consists of two steps: stitching and Euclidean reconstruction. For the image stitching, a minimum of five pairs of non-collinear image corresponding points are required in general cases. In some special configurations when there is column-to-column image correspondence between two panoramas, the number of image corresponding points required can be reduced to three. As for the Euclidean reconstruction, five pairs of non-collinear image corresponding points on the image boundaries are sufficient.},

PACE objectives include extending systematic cloud, aerosol, and ocean biological and biogeochemical data records, making essential ocean color measurements to further understand marine carbon cycles, food-web processes, and ecosystem responses to a changing climate, and improving knowledge of how aerosols influence ocean ecosystems and, conversely, how ocean ecosystems and photochemical processes affect the atmosphere. PACE objectives also encompass management of fisheries, large freshwater bodies, and air and water quality and reducing uncertainties in climate and radiative forcing models of the Earth system. PACE observations will provide information on radiative properties of land surfaces and characterization of the vegetation and soils that dominate their reflectance. The primary PACE instrument is a spectrometer that spans the ultraviolet to shortwave-infrared wavelengths, with a ground sample distance of 1 km at nadir. This payload is complemented by two multiangle polarimeters with spectral ranges that span the visible to near-infrared region. Scheduled for launch in late 2022 to early 2023, the PACE observatory will enable significant advances in the study of Earth’s biogeochemistry, carbon cycle, clouds, hydrosols, and aerosols in the ocean–atmosphere–land system. Here, we present an overview of the PACE mission, including its developmental history, science objectives, instrument payload, observatory characteristics, and data products.},

It uses a thinned, backside-illuminated CCD for high sensitivity and an all-reflective spectrograph with a convex grating in an Offner configuration to produce a nearly distortion-free image. The sensor, which was constructed entirely from commercially available components, has been successfully deployed during several oceanographic experiments in 1999--2001. Here we describe the instrument design and present the results of laboratory characterization and calibration. We also present examples of remote-sensing reflectance data obtained from the LEO-15 site in New Jersey that agrees well with ground-truth measurements.},

Because the solar radiation on the sun-surface-sensor path in the 0.4–2.5 µm visible and near-IR spectral regions is subject to absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols, the hyperspectral imaging data contains atmospheric effects. In order to use hyperspectral imaging data for quantitative remote sensing of land surfaces and ocean color, the atmospheric effects must be removed. Over the years, atmospheric correction algorithms have evolved from the earlier empirical line method and the flat field method to more recent methods based on rigorous radiative transfer modeling approaches. Here, a review of hyperspectral atmospheric correction techniques is presented. Issues related to spectral smoothing are discussed. Suggestions for improvements to the present atmospheric correction algorithms, mainly the addition of a module for modeling atmospheric nitrogen dioxide absorption effects in the visible, are given.},

We present methods and results from field experiments using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with embedded algorithms that focus sampling on features in three dimensions. This was achieved by combining Gaussian process (GP) modeling with onboard robotic autonomy, allowing volumetric measurements to be made at fine scales. Special focus was given to the patchiness of phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll a (Chla), an important factor for understanding biogeochemical processes, such as primary productivity, in the coastal ocean. During multiple field tests in Runde, Norway, the method was successfully used to identify, map, and track the subsurface chlorophyll a maxima (SCM). Results show that the algorithm was able to estimate the SCM volumetrically, enabling the AUV to track the maximum concentration depth within the volume. These data were subsequently verified and supplemented with remote sensing, time series from a buoy and ship-based measurements from a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRf), particle imaging systems, as well as discrete water samples, covering both the large and small scales of the microbial community shaped by coastal dynamics. By bringing together diverse methods from statistics, autonomous control, imaging, and oceanography, the work offers an interdisciplinary perspective in robotic observation of our changing oceans.},
