% \hl{Elizabeth, Evelyn\\}
% The performance requirements in section \ref{sec:requirements} specify a mechanical interface of the payload to the spacecraft that can enable high pointing knowledge and imaging stability. Furthermore, the payload shall survive launch and operations in the space environment. 

% The mechanical interface design provides a rigid connection between a Star-tracker, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the RGB camera, and the HSI camera. Before launch, the payload will be calibrated so that the relative positioning of the instruments is known, and a higher knowledge of imaging can be derived. The payload is also thermally and mechanically decoupled from the spacecraft bus with dampers, to reduce the impact of thermal distortions from the space environment, and to increase the survivability of the launch loads.
